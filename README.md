Build intuition for harmonic, geometric, and arithmetic means
***

We commonly summarize lot of numbers with one number.  This number is often an average.  But, there are different averages.  We will focus on the arithmetic mean, geometric mean, and harmonic mean.  Each has a different sensitivity to outliers. And each has use cases.

The **arithmetic mean** is the "average" the general public is familiar with.  We have two numbers, 40 and 60:

`Arithmetic mean = (40 + 60) / 2 = 50`

The **geometric mean** is the nth root of numbers multiplied together, where n is how many numbers.

* `Geometric mean of 40, 60 = (40*60)^(1/2) = 48.9898 (rounded to four decimals)`

* `Geometric mean of 3, 5, 7, 40 = (3*5*7*40)^(1/4) = 8.0503 (rounded to four decimals)`

The **harmonic mean** is just the **arithmetic mean** but with each number in the numberator raised to the -1 power.  Also, the numerator and denominator are placed in parenthesis and raised to the -1 power.  This is the same as changing `numerator/denominator` to `denominator\numerator`.

`Harmonic mean of 40,60 = ((40^-1+60^-1)/(2))^-1 = (1/40 + 1/60)*2 =
